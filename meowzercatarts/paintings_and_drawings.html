        <h2>Paintings and Drawings</h2>
        <h3>
            I first started developing a skill in drawing when I was nine. I was given a sketch pad for my birthday and I enjoyed drawing it in my free time. Around the time when I was twelve my friends and I started to watch anime. This inspired one of my friends to start drawing in that style which inspired me to do the same. As I continued to draw in an anime style I would look at online references on how to draw. I eventually stumbled on some digital speedpaints on youtube (sped up videos of artists making artwork). Watching these speedpaints inspired me to go digital in my artwork.

            <h2>2021</h2>
            <h3>
                During the end of 2020 I started working at a local small town grocery store. This did not really affect me during the winter as the store was really slow then and I hardly got any hours. But going into 2021 I started going out of winter and receiving a lot more hours. This led to me drawing a lot less due to stress and lack of time. When I donâ€™t know what to draw I usually draw myself so I ended up drawing myself twice this year. When I was done with work and went away from home to college. Even though I was taking 8 classes at college (all which I enjoyed thoroughly) my 50 hr work weeks during the summer made me want to be more productive and less lazy. So as I was in college I was finally able to finish an art project that I am fairly proud of.

            <h3>
                I was still struggling in completing and making art so this led to me relaxing my artstyle a little more (having more rough lines and coloring) in hope to be able to finish and post some of my art projects and making art projects seem like less of a stress in perfectionism.. This led me to being a little bit more interested in developing a digital painterly style instead of the cartoony style that I developed. Going to a more painterly style was inspired by the painting class I took the previous year. I even ended up taking the second painting class offered to fill a couple of leftover credits needed for me to graduate this year. The painterly style also made me more inspired to work on landscapes and less on people. It was because of this that I shifted to the  program that I use today. I bought a license for Clip Studio Paint. Unlike Paint Tools SAI, Clip Studio paint has a lot more brush options and customization, I could even make my own or import digital brushes. This was needed for a painterly style.

            <h3>
                This year I became frustrated with myself because I would start so many beautiful projects but I would never finish. I also really struggled with coming up with ideas for my art. During this year I often would look for ideas from others or redo some of my work. Towards the end of the year I ended up taking a painting class at the college I was going to and started to learn how to use acrylic paint.

            <h3>
                During this year I was into character design and I researched the different aspects of what makes good character design. I started to not focus on art as much as I used to due to the stress of going to college for my last two years of highschool. Although it was this year that I finally had saved up enough money (I paid for half and my parents paid for the rest as a Christmas present) to get a Huion 22 inch pen monitor(a screen that interacts with a pressure sensitive complementary pen). This is something that I still use currently. This huge monitor really helped me be able to be more precise in my art which led to me never really using my old pen tablet anymore.

            <h3>
                This year I tried a bit more to focus on how to show light and shadowing in my pictures. This also was the year where I started to have an art block (lack of ideas of what to draw) as well as the habit of starting a project of ideas but never ending up finishing it and moving on (I started developing and struggling with depression too). Even though I finished very little in the following years, these were the years where I really dove deep into learning different aspects of art and learning different elements of design and color theory.

            <h3>
                Something that I found out about Gimp was that although it was much better than MSPaint, it was overall really poor quality as an art program. So I saved up my money and in 2016 I bought a license for the art program called Paint Tools SAI. This was a program that a lot of the speed painting videos on youtube would use and introduced me to a very important aspect of digital art, pen pressure sensitivity (having digital brushes change based on how hard you press your pen on a graphic tablet). I was very excited when I got this program. I used this program for a long time as it was a pretty high-quality program so I was able to learn a lot and not feel limited. I would rarely implement using Gimp into my art projects but it was mainly because I was so comfortable with it and working on transitioning to the new program.

                I kept working like I was in 2014 till I got a Wacom Intuos pen tablet for my birthday at the end of May . Being able to use this pen tablet had increased my ability to learn and create digital art as a lot of digital artists rely on using some sort of pen tablet. During this year I feel like I was very passionate for my art and created a lot.

            <h3>
                One of my brothers saw that I was trying to do digital art and in 2014 introduced me to a free image altering program called Gimp. Around the same time another one of my brothers was starting to submit some of their own art online on  a site called Deviantart and got me to do the same. So I kept on working on my art in Gimp but I was only working with a mouse (sometimes only a laptop touchpad) which put on a challenge when drawing. But this handicap actually worked to my advantage as I really got to know the compex program I was working with.

                This was the time when I first started to learn digital art I used the program MS Paint. during these early times I would often look at different drawings and draw different parts of my drawing from different parts of other drawings (copying the hair from one drawing and the clothes from the other). I did this for learning purposes and continued to do this for a couple of years. I also did some traditional drawings (pen and paper) alongside.
