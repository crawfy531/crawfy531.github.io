      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to have a place online where I store all my art (old and new).
        This website will also be used for people who are interested in commissioning me to
        do some art. What will be included is digital and traditional drawings and paintings as well as 
        some audio files of some of the music I have made electronically.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I have put out my art on online sources, some being facebook and deviantart, and I plan to
        link to this website in order to have them not only see a veriety of my art work, but also be able to have
        the oportunity to view commisson avalability and rates as well as contact information. My family and friends would

        Who am I?

My name is Jennifer Crawford and I am an artist. The reason why this website is called MeowzerCat Arts is because my online username is sometimes Cats531 and other times Meowzer, so I decided to combine it. I do digital and traditional cartoons as well as paintings. Another thing that I create is digital music. This website is a place where I keep a record of all of my art  (organized by year). It is also a place where I will say if I am open for commission or not as well as how to contact me if you want a commission. If I am open for commission I will also display my current rates on this home page(I will not show my rates when I am not open for commision).

My family has been my greatest supporters in my progression in art. They have only encouraged me to progress in art and even suggested making it my job. But I was also told that some hobbies are better off just hobbies and I feel like my art is like that. There was a point in my life where I considered trying to make digital art a career but honestly I see it more as a hobby and I don’t exactly enjoy doing it as a job. Concerning commissions, I will only take one if I feel like I can have fun with it and am interested in the concept. I also can’t be too busy or stressed at the time I take on a commission because it will cause unnecessary stress.

Am I open for commission?: No

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        So while I was in the 6th grade I joined the school band and played the flute. I continued in band until I basically left my highschool and went to a community college for my last two years of highschool. I was even in the school marching band. While I was in a band I got to ,not only learn how to play music, but also later learn some music theory of what sounds good and why. During this time and even now I like the techno and electronic genre of music. I also have a mom who produces her own music, has a recording studio in her house, and has even published her music on the radio. Between these three things I found an interest in making my own music. I decided to download MuseScore and experiment with notes there and try to make my own techno songs. I would not only make my own music but also try to write sheet music for songs that I really like (I would try to match note by note to the song). I still use MuseScore (practically the MS Paint of music making software) to make music even though I have tried to work with other music making programs because I find it really easy to navigate through and use.

      <h3>Drawings and Paintings</h3>
      <p>
        I first started developing a skill in drawing when I was nine. I was given a sketch pad for my birthday and I enjoyed drawing it in my free time. Around the time when I was twelve my friends and I started to watch anime. This inspired one of my friends to start drawing in that style which inspired me to do the same. As I continued to draw in an anime style I would look at online references on how to draw. I eventually stumbled on some digital speedpaints on youtube (sped up videos of artists making artwork). Watching these speedpaints inspired me to go digital in my artwork. 


2013
This was the time when I first started to learn digital art I used the program MS Paint. during these early times I would often look at different drawings and draw different parts of my drawing from different parts of other drawings (copying the hair from one drawing and the clothes from the other). I did this for learning purposes and continued to do this for a couple of years. I also did some traditional drawings (pen and paper) alongside.

2014
One of my brothers saw that I was trying to do digital art and in 2014 introduced me to a free image altering program called Gimp. Around the same time another one of my brothers was starting to submit some of their own art online on  a site called Deviantart and got me to do the same. So I kept on working on my art in Gimp but I was only working with a mouse (sometimes only a laptop touchpad) which put on a challenge when drawing. But this handicap actually worked to my advantage as I really got to know the compex program I was working with.

2015
I kept working like I was in 2014 till I got a Wacom Intuos pen tablet for my birthday at the end of May . Being able to use this pen tablet had increased my ability to learn and create digital art as a lot of digital artists rely on using some sort of pen tablet. During this year I feel like I was very passionate for my art and created a lot.
2016
Something that I found out about Gimp was that although it was much better than MSPaint, it was overall really poor quality as an art program. So I saved up my money and in 2016 I bought a license for the art program called Paint Tools SAI. This was a program that a lot of the speed painting videos on youtube would use and introduced me to a very important aspect of digital art, pen pressure sensitivity (having digital brushes change based on how hard you press your pen on a graphic tablet). I was very excited when I got this program. I used this program for a long time as it was a pretty high-quality program so I was able to learn a lot and not feel limited. I would rarely implement using Gimp into my art projects but it was mainly because I was so comfortable with it and working on transitioning to the new program.

2017
This year I tried a bit more to focus on how to show light and shadowing in my pictures. This also was the year where I started to have an art block (lack of ideas of what to draw) as well as the habit of starting a project of ideas but never ending up finishing it and moving on (I started developing and struggling with depression too). Even though I finished very little in the following years, these were the years where I really dove deep into learning different aspects of art and learning different elements of design and color theory.

2018
During this year I was into character design and I researched the different aspects of what makes good character design. I started to not focus on art as much as I used to due to the stress of going to college for my last two years of highschool. Although it was this year that I finally had saved up enough money (I paid for half and my parents paid for the rest as a Christmas present) to get a Huion 22 inch pen monitor(a screen that interacts with a pressure sensitive complementary pen). This is something that I still use currently. This huge monitor really helped me be able to be more precise in my art which led to me never really using my old pen tablet anymore.

2019
This year I became frustrated with myself because I would start so many beautiful projects but I would never finish. I also really struggled with coming up with ideas for my art. During this year I often would look for ideas from others or redo some of my work. Towards the end of the year I ended up taking a painting class at the college I was going to and started to learn how to use acrylic paint.

2020
I was still struggling in completing and making art so this led to me relaxing my artstyle a little more (having more rough lines and coloring) in hope to be able to finish and post some of my art projects and making art projects seem like less of a stress in perfectionism.. This led me to being a little bit more interested in developing a digital painterly style instead of the cartoony style that I developed. Going to a more painterly style was inspired by the painting class I took the previous year. I even ended up taking the second painting class offered to fill a couple of leftover credits needed for me to graduate this year. The painterly style also made me more inspired to work on landscapes and less on people. It was because of this that I shifted to the  program that I use today. I bought a license for Clip Studio Paint. Unlike Paint Tools SAI, Clip Studio paint has a lot more brush options and customization, I could even make my own or import digital brushes. This was needed for a painterly style.

2021
During the end of 2020 I started working at a local small town grocery store. This did not really affect me during the winter as the store was really slow then and I hardly got any hours. But going into 2021 I started going out of winter and receiving a lot more hours. This led to me drawing a lot less due to stress and lack of time. When I don’t know what to draw I usually draw myself so I ended up drawing myself twice this year. When I was done with work and went away from home to college. Even though I was taking 8 classes at college (all which I enjoyed thoroughly) my 50 hr work weeks during the summer made me want to be more productive and less lazy. So as I was in college I was finally able to finish an art project that I am fairly proud of.
