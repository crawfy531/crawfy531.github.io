        <h3>
            My name is Jennifer Crawford and I am an artist. The reason why this website is called MeowzerCat Arts is because my online username is sometimes Cats531 and other times Meowzer, so I decided to combine it. I do digital and traditional cartoons as well as paintings. Another thing that I create is digital music. This website is a place where I keep a record of all of my art  (organized by year). It is also a place where I will say if I am open for commission or not as well as how to contact me if you want a commission. If I am open for commission I will also display my current rates on this home page(I will not show my rates when I am not open for commision).
        </h3>
        <h2>Am I open for commissions? No</h2>
        <h3>
            My family has been my greatest supporters in my progression in art. They have only encouraged me to progress in art and even suggested making it my job. But I was also told that some hobbies are better off just hobbies and I feel like my art is like that. There was a point in my life where I considered trying to make digital art a career but honestly I see it more as a hobby and I don’t exactly enjoy doing it as a job. Concerning commissions, I will only take one if I feel like I can have fun with it and am interested in the concept. I also can’t be too busy or stressed at the time I take on a commission because it will cause unnecessary stress.
