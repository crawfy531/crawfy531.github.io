              So while I was in the 6th grade I joined the school band and played the flute. I continued in band until I basically left my highschool and went to a community college for my last two years of highschool. I was even in the school marching band. While I was in a band I got to, not only learn how to play music, but also later learn some music theory of what sounds good and why. During this time and even now I like the techno and electronic genre of music. I also have a mom who produces her own music, has a recording studio in her house, and has even published her music on the radio. Between these three things I found an interest in making my own music. I decided to download MuseScore and experiment with notes there and try to make my own techno songs. I would not only make my own music but also try to write sheet music for songs that I really like (I would try to match note by note to the song). I still use MuseScore (practically the MS Paint of music making software) to make music even though I have tried to work with other music making programs because I find it really easy to navigate through and use.
